# Overview

Nova's Pinnacle is a console-based game developed as a CS201 project using Java. In this text-based adventure, the player embarks on a journey to defeat three formidable enemies: a Goblin, a Skeleton, and a Dragon, each increasing in difficulty.

Upon starting the game, the player selects a difficulty level and receives three potions. These potions can be strategically used to either boost the player's attack damage or add a temporary shield to reduce incoming enemy damage. The player's goal is to manage their health, attack damage, and limited potions effectively to conquer all three levels.
